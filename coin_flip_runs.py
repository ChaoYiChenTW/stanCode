-----------------------
This program should simulate coin flip(s)
with the number of runs input by users.
A 'run' is defined as consecutive results
on either 'H' or 'T'. For example, 'HHHHHTHTT'
is regarded as a 2-run result.
Your program should stop immediately after your
coin flip results reach the runs!
